The following is the album description written by Adam Young for his "The Ascent of Everest" album he released on May 1st, 2016.

No one knew where the roof of the world was until the 19th century. By 1865, the highest peak was known as Mount Everest and it wasn’t until May 1953 that a beekeeper from New Zealand and a Nepalese Sherpa became the first to reach the summit. My interpretation of this astounding human feat is a collection of frozen, wind-burned, sun-bleached instrumentals that become more and more tattered and torn as you listen to them. The higher Hillary and Norgay climbed, the more extreme the elements became. Despite great dangers, they succeeded and returned as heroes. Yet another example of man’s triumph despite insurmountable odds, the ascent of Everest remains a story that will always inspire me.
